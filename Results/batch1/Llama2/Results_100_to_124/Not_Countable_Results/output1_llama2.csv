code review:
I'd suggest, instead of using a property, you add a `getCreateRecordCallback` method. This has a couple of advantages: 1.) It allows you to return null here in the abstract factory, since otherwise the code changes here constitute a behavior change (causing subclasses to use getSolrRecord instead of no custom callback by default). 2.) It allows you to override less code in SolrReservesBackendFactory and SolrWebBackendFactory below, since you can put the custom callback logic in its own method.

code review:
I'd suggest, instead of using a property, you add a `getCreateRecordCallback` method. This has a couple of advantages: 1.) It allows you to return null here in the abstract factory, since otherwise the code changes here constitute a behavior change (causing subclasses to use getSolrRecord instead of no custom callback by default). 2.)

I'd suggest, instead of using a property, you add a `getCreateRecordCallback` method. This has a couple of advantages: 1.) It allows you to return null here in the abstract factory, since otherwise the code changes here constitute a behavior change (causing subclasses to use getSolrRecord instead of no custom callback by default). 2.) It allows you to override less code in SolrReservesBackendFactory and SolrWebBackendFactory below, since you can put the custom callback logic in its own method.

I'd suggest, instead of using a property, you add a `getCreateRecordCallback` method. This has a couple of advantages: 1.) It allows you to return null here in the abstract factory, since otherwise the code changes here constitute a behavior change (causing subclasses to use getSolrRecord instead of no custom callback by default). 2.) It allows you to override less code in SolrReservesBackendFactory and SolrWebBackendFactory below, since you can put the custom callback logic in its own method.

I'd suggest, instead of using a property, you add a `getCreateRecordCallback` method. This has a couple of advantages: 1.) It allows you to return null here in the abstract factory, since otherwise the code changes here constitute a behavior change (causing subclasses to use getSolrRecord instead of no custom callback by default). 2.) It allows you to override less code in SolrReservesBackendFactory and SolrWebBackendFactory below, since you can put the custom callback logic in its own method.

I'd suggest, instead of using a property, you add a `getCreateRecordCallback` method. This has a couple of advantages: 1.) It allows you to return null here in the abstract factory, since otherwise the code changes here constitute a behavior change (causing subclasses to use getSolrRecord instead of no custom callback by default). 2.) It allows you to override less code in SolrReservesBackendFactory and SolrWebBackendFactory below, since you can put the custom callback logic in its own method.

The problem with putting it here is that now the user's preferred background might not be visible where they started editing the map.

Could you move the `context.storage` code down to the block where `best` gets set...

I'd suggest, instead of using a property, you add a `getCreateRecordCallback` method. This has a couple of advantages: 1.) It allows you to return null here in the abstract factory, since otherwise the code changes here constitute a behavior change (causing subclasses to use getSolrRecord instead of no custom callback by default). 2.) It allows you to override less code in SolrReservesBackendFactory and SolrWebBackendFactory below, since you can put the custom callback logic in its own method.

code review:
The problem with putting it here is that now the user's preferred background might not be visible where they started editing the map. This is especially a problem if a user is entering iD via a task manager or QA tool, and editing in a place that is not where they normally use iD.

code review:
I'd suggest, instead of using a property, you add a `getCreateRecordCallback` method. This has a couple of advantages: 1.) It allows you to return null here in the abstract factory, since otherwise the code changes here constitute a behavior change (causing subclasses to use getSolrRecord instead of no custom callback by default). 2.) It allows you to override less code in SolrReservesBackendFactory and SolrWebBackendFactory below, since you can put the custom callback logic in its own method.

I'd suggest, instead of using a property, you add a `getCreateRecordCallback` method. This has a couple of advantages: 1.) It allows you to return null here in the abstract factory, since otherwise the code changes here constitute a behavior change (causing subclasses to use getSolrRecord instead of no custom callback by default). 2.) It allows you to override less code in SolrReservesBackendFactory and SolrWebBackendFactory below, since you can put the custom callback logic in its own method.

I'd suggest, instead of using a property, you add a `getCreateRecordCallback` method. This has a couple of advantages: 1.) It allows you to return null here in the abstract factory, since otherwise the code changes here constitute a behavior change (causing subclasses to use getSolrRecord instead of no custom callback by default). 2.) It allows you to override less code in SolrReservesBackendFactory and SolrWebBackendFactory below, since you can put the custom callback logic in its own method.

I'd suggest, instead of using a property, you add a `getCreateRecordCallback` method. This has a couple of advantages: 1.) It allows you to return null here in the abstract factory, since otherwise the code changes here constitute a behavior change (causing subclasses to use getSolrRecord instead of no custom callback by default). 2.) It allows you to override less code in SolrReservesBackendFactory and SolrWebBackendFactory below, since you can put the custom callback logic in its own method.

It allows you to return null here in the abstract factory, since otherwise the code changes here constitute a behavior change (causing subclasses to use getSolrRecord instead of no custom callback by default). 2.) It allows you to override less code in SolrReservesBackendFactory and SolrWebBackendFactory below, since you can put the custom callback logic in its own method.

I'd suggest, instead of using a property, you add a `getCreateRecordCallback` method. This has a couple of advantages: 1.) It allows you to return null here in the abstract factory, since otherwise the code changes here constitute a behavior change (causing subclasses to use getSolrRecord instead of no custom callback by default). 2.) It allows you to override less code in SolrReservesBackendFactory and SolrWebBackendFactory below, since you can put the custom callback logic in its own method.

I'd suggest, instead of using a property, you add a `getCreateRecordCallback` method. This has a couple of advantages: 1.)

It allows you to override less code in SolrReservesBackendFactory and SolrWebBackendFactory below, since you can put the custom callback logic in its own method.

I'd suggest, instead of using a property, you add a `getCreateRecordCallback` method. This has a couple of advantages: 1.) It allows you to return null here in the abstract factory, since otherwise the code changes here constitute a behavior change (causing subclasses to use getSolrRecord instead of no custom callback by default). 2.) It allows you to override less code in SolrReservesBackendFactory and SolrWebBackendFactory below, since you can put the custom callback logic in its own method.

It allows you to return null here in the abstract factory, since otherwise the code changes here constitute a behavior change (causing subclasses to use getSolrRecord instead of no custom callback by default). 2.) It allows you to override less code in SolrReservesBackendFactory and SolrWebBackendFactory below, since you can put the custom callback logic in its own method."

I'd suggest, instead of using a property, you add a `getCreateRecordCallback` method. This has a couple of advantages: 1.) It allows you to return null here in the abstract factory, since otherwise the code changes here constitute a behavior change (causing subclasses to use getSolrRecord instead of no custom callback by default). 2.) It allows you to override less code in SolrReservesBackendFactory and SolrWebBackendFactory below, since you can put the custom callback logic in its own method.

The problem with putting it here is that now the user's preferred background might not be visible where they started editing the map. This is especially a problem if a user is entering iD via a task manager or QA tool, and editing in a place that is not where they normally use iD. Could you move the `context.storage` code down to the block where `best` gets set...

It allows you to return null here in the abstract factory, since otherwise the code changes here constitute a behavior change (causing subclasses to use getSolrRecord instead of no custom callback by default). 2.) It allows you to override less code in SolrReservesBackendFactory and SolrWebBackendFactory below, since you can put the custom callback logic in its own method."

I'd suggest, instead of using a property, you add a `getCreateRecordCallback` method. This has a couple of advantages: 1.) It allows you to return null here in the abstract factory, since otherwise the code changes here constitute a behavior change (causing subclasses to use getSolrRecord instead of no custom callback by default). 2.) It allows you to override less code in SolrReservesBackendFactory and SolrWebBackendFactory below, since you can put the custom callback logic in its own method.

It allows you to return null here in the abstract factory, since otherwise the code changes here constitute a behavior change (causing subclasses to use getSolrRecord instead of no custom callback by default). 2.) It allows you to override less code in SolrReservesBackendFactory and SolrWebBackendFactory below, since you can put the custom callback logic in its own method."

I'd suggest, instead of using a property, you add a `getCreateRecordCallback` method. This has a couple of advantages: 1.) It allows you to return null here in the abstract factory, since otherwise the code changes here constitute a behavior change (causing subclasses to use getSolrRecord instead of no custom callback by default). 2.) It allows you to override less code in SolrReservesBackendFactory and SolrWebBackendFactory below, since you can put the custom callback logic in its own method.

The problem with putting it here is that now the user's preferred background might not be visible where they started editing the map. This is especially a problem if a user is entering iD via a task manager or QA tool, and editing in a place that is not where they normally use iD. Could you move the `context.storage` code down to the block where `best` gets set... Then in there set a variable called `recent` that contains this BackgroundSource only if it is valid in the current visible extent. Then a few lines later do `background.baseLayerSource(findSource(chosen) || recent || best || ...etc)`

It allows you to return null here in the abstract factory, since otherwise the code changes here constitute a behavior change (causing subclasses to use getSolrRecord instead of no custom callback by default). 2.) It allows you to override less code in SolrReservesBackendFactory and SolrWebBackendFactory below, since you can put the custom callback logic in its own method."

I'd suggest, instead of using a property, you add a `getCreateRecordCallback` method. This has a couple of advantages: 1.) It allows you to return null here in the abstract factory, since otherwise the code changes here constitute a behavior change (causing subclasses to use getSolrRecord instead of no custom callback by default). 2.) It allows you to override less code in SolrReservesBackendFactory and SolrWebBackendFactory below, since you can put the custom callback logic in its own method.

Code review:
I'd suggest, instead of using a property, you add a `getCreateRecordCallback` method. This has a couple of advantages: 1.) It allows you to return null here in the abstract factory, since otherwise the code changes here constitute a behavior change (causing subclasses to use getSolrRecord instead of no custom callback by default). 2.) It allows you to override less code in SolrReservesBackendFactory and SolrWebBackendFactory below, since you can put the custom callback logic in its own method.

Code review:
I'd suggest, instead of using a property, you add a `getCreateRecordCallback` method. This has a couple of advantages: 1.) It allows you to return null here in the abstract factory, since otherwise the code changes here constitute a behavior change (causing subclasses to use getSolrRecord instead of no custom callback by default). 2.) It allows you to override less code in SolrReservesBackendFactory and SolrWebBackendFactory below, since you can put the custom callback logic in its own method.
