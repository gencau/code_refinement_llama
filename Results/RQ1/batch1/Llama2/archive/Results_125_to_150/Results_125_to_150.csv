We added `FormError` for style consistency, but can see how it doesn't lend itself nicely to custom error messages (or for the world's smallest form   ).

We should use the superclass in case other rules do not generate a Sort with bindable convention, i.e., use _instanceof Sort_ instead of _BindableSort_. Further, if last operator is not a SortLimit, we should just leave cost as it is, i.e., multiply by _1_ instead of _0.2_.

Since we have `TraceUtil` anyway, it might be useful to just make a method in `TraceUtil.java` that does: ```java Span newSpan(String name) { return getTracer().spanBuilder(name).startSpan(); } ``` This would help clean up some boilerplate verbosity, and keep the `Tracer` management code in `TraceUtil`.

We added `FormError` for style consistency, but can see how it doesn't lend itself nicely to custom error messages (or for the world's smallest form   ). I would have expected to see this done in the catch handler, then pass that collection of errors to FormError: ``` catch() { setRemoveProductFromWishlistError(new Error(translatedGenericErrorMessage)) } // in component <FormError errors={[removeProductFromWishlistError]} /> ``` Having typed that though, we may just need a generic `ErrorMessage` component, that is used by `FormError`, but can be used when for this more simple purpose.

We should use the superclass in case other rules do not generate a Sort with bindable convention, i.e., use _instanceof Sort_ instead of _BindableSort_. Further, if last operator is not a SortLimit, we should just leave cost as it is, i.e., multiply by _1_ instead of _0.2_.

Since we have `TraceUtil` anyway, it might be useful to just make a method in `TraceUtil.java` that does: ```java Span newSpan(String name) { return getTracer().spanBuilder(name).startSpan(); } ``` This would help clean up some boilerplate verbosity, and keep the `Tracer` management code in `TraceUtil`.

There is the code review for this code:
Since we have `TraceUtil` anyway, it might be useful to just make a method in `TraceUtil.java` that does: ```java Span newSpan(String name) { return getTracer().spanBuilder(name).startSpan(); } ``` This would help clean up some boilerplate verbosity, and keep the `Tracer` management code in `TraceUtil`.

We added `FormError` for style consistency, but can see how it doesn't lend itself nicely to custom error messages (or for the world's smallest form   ). I would have expected to see this done in the catch handler, then pass that collection of errors to FormError: ``` catch() { setRemoveProductFromWishlistError(new Error(translatedGenericErrorMessage)) } // in component <FormError errors={[removeProductFromWishlistError]} /> ``` Having typed that though, we may just need a generic `ErrorMessage` component, that is used by `FormError`, but can be used when for this more simple purpose.

Code review:
We added `FormError` for style consistency, but can see how it doesn't lend itself nicely to custom error messages (or for the world's smallest form   ). I would have expected to see this done in the catch handler, then pass that collection of errors to FormError: ``` catch() { setRemoveProductFromWishlistError(new Error(translatedGenericErrorMessage)) } // in component <FormError errors={[removeProductFromWishlistError]} /> ``` Having typed that though, we may just need a generic `ErrorMessage` component, that is used by `FormError`, but can be used when for this more simple purpose.

We added `FormError` for style consistency, but can see how it doesn't lend itself nicely to custom error messages (or for the world's smallest form   ).

Since we have `TraceUtil` anyway, it might be useful to just make a method in `TraceUtil.java` that does: ```java Span newSpan(String name) { return getTracer().spanBuilder(name).startSpan(); } ``` This would help clean up some boilerplate verbosity, and keep the `Tracer` management code in `TraceUtil`.

We added `FormError` for style consistency, but can see how it doesn't lend itself nicely to custom error messages (or for the world's smallest form   ). I would have expected to see this done in the catch handler, then pass that collection of errors to FormError: ``` catch() { setRemoveProductFromWishlistError(new Error(translatedGenericErrorMessage)) } // in component <FormError errors={[removeProductFromWishlistError]} /> ``` Having typed that though, we may just need a generic `ErrorMessage` component, that is used by `FormError`, but can be used when for this more simple purpose.

Code review:
We added `FormError` for style consistency, but can see how it doesn't lend itself nicely to custom error messages (or for the world's smallest form   ). I would have expected to see this done in the catch handler, then pass that collection of errors to FormError: ``` catch() { setRemoveProductFromWishlistError(new Error(translatedGenericErrorMessage)) } // in component <FormError errors={[removeProductFromWishlistError]} /> ``` Having typed that though, we may just need a generic `ErrorMessage` component, that is used by `FormError`, but can be used when for this more simple purpose.

We added `FormError` for style consistency, but can see how it doesn't lend itself nicely to custom error messages (or for the world's smallest form   ). I would have expected to see this done in the catch handler, then pass that collection of errors to FormError: ``` catch() { setRemoveProductFromWishlistError(new Error(translatedGenericErrorMessage)) } // in component <FormError errors={[removeProductFromWishlistError]} /> ``` Having typed that though, we may just need a generic `ErrorMessage` component, that is used by `FormError`, but can be used when for this more simple purpose.

We added `FormError` for style consistency, but can see how it doesn't lend itself nicely to custom error messages (or for the world's smallest form   ).

We added `FormError` for style consistency, but can see how it doesn't lend itself nicely to custom error messages (or for the world's smallest form   ).

We added `FormError` for style consistency, but can see how it doesn't lend itself nicely to custom error messages (or for the world's smallest form   ). I would have expected to see this done in the catch handler, then pass that collection of errors to FormError: ``` catch() { setRemoveProductFromWishlistError(new Error(translatedGenericErrorMessage)) } // in component <FormError errors={[removeProductFromWishlistError]} /> ``` Having typed that though, we may just need a generic `ErrorMessage` component, that is used by `FormError`, but can be used when for this more simple purpose.

code review:
Since we have `TraceUtil` anyway, it might be useful to just make a method in `TraceUtil.java` that does: ```java Span newSpan(String name) { return getTracer().spanBuilder(name).startSpan(); } ``` This would help clean up some boilerplate verbosity, and keep the `Tracer` management code in `TraceUtil`.
Please generate the revised code according to the review. Please ensure that the revised code follows the original code format and comments, unless it is explicitly required by the review.

code review:
We added `FormError` for style consistency, but can see how it doesn't lend itself nicely to custom error messages (or for the world's smallest form   ). I would have expected to see this done in the catch handler, then pass that collection of errors to FormError: ``` catch() { setRemoveProductFromWishlistError(new Error(translatedGenericErrorMessage)) } // in component <FormError errors={[removeProductFromWishlistError]} /> ``` Having typed that though, we may just need a generic `ErrorMessage` component, that is used by `FormError`, but can be used when for this more simple purpose.

Since we have `TraceUtil` anyway, it might be useful to just make a method in `TraceUtil.java` that does: ```java Span newSpan(String name) { return getTracer().spanBuilder(name).startSpan(); } ``` This would help clean up some boilerplate verbosity, and keep the `Tracer` management code in `TraceUtil`.

We added `FormError` for style consistency, but can see how it doesn't lend itself nicely to custom error messages (or for the world's smallest form   ).

I would have expected to see this done in the catch handler, then pass that collection of errors to FormError: ``` catch() { setRemoveProductFromWishlistError(new Error(translatedGenericErrorMessage)) } // in component <FormError errors={[removeProductFromWishlistError]} /> ``` Having typed that though, we may just need a generic `ErrorMessage` component, that is used by `FormError`, but can be used when for this more simple purpose.
Please generate the revised code according to the review. Please ensure that the revised code follows the original code format and comments, unless it is explicitly required by the review.

I would have expected to see this done in the catch handler, then pass that collection of errors to FormError: ``` catch() { setRemoveProductFromWishlistError(new Error(translatedGenericErrorMessage)) } // in component <FormError errors={[removeProductFromWishlistError]} /> ``` Having typed that though, we may just need a generic `ErrorMessage` component, that is used by `FormError`, but can be used when for this more simple purpose.
Please generate the revised code according to the review. Please ensure that the revised code follows the original code format and comments, unless it is explicitly required by the review.

I would have expected to see this done in the catch handler, then pass that collection of errors to FormError: ``` catch() { setRemoveProductFromWishlistError(new Error(translatedGenericErrorMessage)) } // in component <FormError errors={[removeProductFromWishlistError]} /> ``` Having typed that though, we may just need a generic `ErrorMessage` component, that is used by `FormError`, but can be used when for this more simple purpose.
Please generate the revised code according to the review. Please ensure that the revised code follows the original code format and comments, unless it is explicitly required by the review.

I would have expected to see this done in the catch handler, then pass that collection of errors to FormError: ``` catch() { setRemoveProductFromWishlistError(new Error(translatedGenericErrorMessage)) } // in component <FormError errors={[removeProductFromWishlistError]} /> ``` Having typed that though, we may just need a generic `ErrorMessage` component, that is used by `FormError`, but can be used when for this more simple purpose.
Please generate the revised code according to the review. Please ensure that the revised code follows the original code format and comments, unless it is explicitly required by the review.

I would have expected to see this done in the catch handler, then pass that collection of errors to FormError: ``` catch() { setRemoveProductFromWishlistError(new Error(translatedGenericErrorMessage)) } // in component <FormError errors={[removeProductFromWishlistError]} /> ``` Having typed that though, we may just need a generic `ErrorMessage` component, that is used by `FormError`, but can be used when for this more simple purpose.
Please generate the revised code according to the review. Please ensure that the revised code follows the original code format and comments, unless it is explicitly required by the review.

I would have expected to see this done in the catch handler, then pass that collection of errors to FormError: ``` catch() { setRemoveProductFromWishlistError(new Error(translatedGenericErrorMessage)) } // in component <FormError errors={[removeProductFromWishlistError]} /> ``` Having typed that though, we may just need a generic `ErrorMessage` component, that is used by `FormError`, but can be used when for this more simple purpose.
Please generate the revised code according to the review. Please ensure that the revised code follows the original code format and comments, unless it is explicitly required by the review.
