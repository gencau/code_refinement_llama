    } yield {
      storeInSubgraph(tgt, subgraph)
      Edge(srcMethod, tgt, label = child.dispatchType.stripSuffix(""_DISPATCH""))
    }.distinct
```

The for comprehension saves the reader from parsing the flatMap/map etc... a matter of style, up to you really.
Note that I didn't ask the compiler for feedback on the above yet...

There is the code review for this code:
Not a big fan of omitting the brackets like python, maybe once we move to Scala 3, but until then we should stay consistent with the rest of the codebase and use braces around `if` and `else`.

The reason for this is that there's a subtlety with Scala 2 where even if it's well-indented, if there are multiple clauses they silently escape the `if/else`, for example if we have:

```scala
if (bla)
  println(""bla"")
else
  println(""not bla"")
  println(""still not bla"")
```

the last statement will always execute, which is weird from the reader's point of view, so whenever we use non-trivial clauses like here it's better to keep the braces.

I suggest to only recover here if the process [exits with 1](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-check-ignore#_exit_status):
```scala
.recover { case ex: ProcessFailedException if ex.exitValue === 1 => false }
```
This would require to make `exitValue` a field of `ProcessFailedException`. It is currently only a constructor parameter.
