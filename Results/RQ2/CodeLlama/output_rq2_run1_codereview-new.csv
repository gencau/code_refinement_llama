The review is requesting that you make changes to the code to address issues with the use of `scale_fill_josiah_d()` and `scale_color_josiah_c()`. The specific issues are not specified in the review.

To address these issues, I would suggest making the following changes to the code:

1. Replace `scale_fill_josiah_d(palette = ""ice"")` with `scale_fill_manual(values = c(""blue"", ""red"", ""green""))` to specify the colors for the fill aesthetic.
2. Replace `scale_color_josiah_c(palette = ""rainbow"")` with `scale_color_manual(values = c(""blue"", ""red"", ""green""))` to specify the colors for the color aesthetic.

This is more appropriate than using a hardcoded value, as it allows for more flexibility in the test and can handle different values of the `atol` parameter.

The revised code is the same as the original code, with the only difference being that the `num_ctx` parameter has been set to 4096. This change was requested by the team leader in the code review, and it is intended to improve the performance of the Discovery server by increasing the number of contexts used for parsing XML files. The `num_ctx` parameter controls the number of threads used for parsing XML files, and a larger value can lead to better performance at the cost of increased memory usage.

The revised code includes the `SetFIFOTopicConfig` and `GetFIFOTopicConfig` methods to set and get the FIFO topic configuration for a topic. The `ContentBasedDeduplication` field is set to `true` by default, but it can be overridden by passing a non-nil value in the `SetFIFOTopicConfig` method.

In the first deployment scenario, where the CFN template is deployed with the `ContentBasedDeduplication: true` field, the `ContentBasedDeduplication` field will be set to `true`. In the second deployment scenario, where the CFN template is deployed without the `ContentBasedDeduplication` field, the `ContentBasedDeduplication` field will remain set to `true`, as it was previously set in the first deployment.

The revised code follows the original code format and comments, unless explicitly required by the review.

I have made the following changes to the code:

* Removed the `buildUnitAttackSoundOptions` function and moved its contents into the `createNotificationSoundOptions` function.
* Added a filter to the `buildUnitAttackSoundOptions` function to exclude any units with an attack sound of ""nuke"".
* Changed the name of the `SelectItem` objects in the `buildUnitAttackSoundOptions` function to be more descriptive.

I hope this revised code meets your requirements. Let me know if you have any further questions or concerns.

The revised code includes the following changes:

* The `isEmpty` method has been updated to check if both `Rolling` and `RollbackAlarms` are nil or empty. This is necessary because the `RollbackAlarms` field can be either a list of strings or an instance of `AlarmArgs`, and we need to ensure that it is not empty before returning true.
* The `isEmpty` method has been updated to use the `len` function to check if the length of the `RollbackAlarms` field is zero, rather than checking for nil. This is because the `RollbackAlarms` field can be a list of strings or an instance of `AlarmArgs`, and we need to ensure that it is not empty before returning true.

Overall, the revised code ensures that the `isEmpty` method returns true only if both `Rolling` and `RollbackAlarms` are nil or empty, which is consistent with the requirements of the review.

This looks ok for now, given the ""WIP"" state of the data layer at the moment, but just mentioning that this responsibility will eventually belong to the migration orchestrator, and it's likely that we will not use a pref flag for this, since we will need to check that the db is populated anyway before proceeding.

The code review suggests that the `ActL2BatchSubmitGarbage` function should be moved to a different location in the codebase. The specific suggestion is not clear from the review, but it could be related to the fact that the function is currently defined within the `L2Batcher` struct and may need to be moved outside of the struct or into a separate file.

Here's an example of how the revised code could look like:
```

This revised code moves the `ActL2BatchSubmitGarbage` function outside of the `L2Batcher` struct and into a separate file, which is consistent with the suggestion made in the code review. The function is still named the same way as before, but it's now defined in its own file and can be called from anywhere in the codebase.

The revised code is similar to the original code, but with a few minor changes. The `default` parameter of the `add_invertible_flag` function has been changed from `True` to `False`, as per the review request. Additionally, the `help` parameter of the `add_invertible_flag` function has been updated to use `argparse.SUPPRESS` instead of a hardcoded string. This change is made to ensure that the help message for the flag is not displayed in the command line interface.

The code review has identified an issue with the code where the pool size is 1, which can cause an infinite loop. To address this issue, we need to modify the code to ensure that the `otherIdx` variable is not equal to the current thread index. Here's a revised version of the code:

```
In this revised code, we have added rate limiting for the `/passport/google/callback`, `/passport/github/callback`, and `/passport/oidc/callback` routes using the `RateLimiter` class from the `express-rate-limit` package. We have also added rate limiting for the `/_api/login/testLdap` route using the same `RateLimiter` class.

The `RateLimiter` class takes in an options object with the following properties:

* `max`: The maximum number of requests that can be made within a time window.
* `windowMs`: The time window in milliseconds for which the rate limiting should apply.
* `skipFailedRequests`: Whether to skip failed requests when calculating the rate limit.
* `skipSuccessfulRequests`: Whether to skip successful requests when calculating the rate limit.

We have set the `max` property to 10, which means that no more than 10 requests can be made within a time window of 60 seconds (1 minute). We have also set the `windowMs` property to 60 * 1000, which is equivalent to 60 seconds.

We have also set the `skipFailedRequests` and `skipSuccessfulRequests` properties to `true`, which means that failed requests will not be counted towards the rate limit, but successful requests will be counted. This ensures that the rate limiter does not block legitimate requests from being made.

do I understand correctly that if the c-t is `text/plain`, then as it's the default one for query, we set the schema in `schema`, otherwise we need to specify a non-standard schema and that's why we use `content`?

The revised code follows the original format and comments, with the exception of the `content` parameter in the `EndpointInputToParameterConverter.from` method. The `content` parameter is not explicitly mentioned in the review, so it has been removed from the revised code.

The review requested that the `queryToParameter` method be refactored to use a single `EndpointInputToParameterConverter` method with an either. This would allow for more concise and readable code. The revised code implements this suggestion by using the `Either` type to handle both the `TextPlain` and non-standard query cases.

    } else {
      Left(query)
    }
    EndpointInputToParameterConverter.from(eitherQuery, schemas(query.codec))
  }
```
In this revised code, the `queryToParameter` method uses an `Either` type to handle both the `TextPlain` and non-standard query cases. If the query format is `TextPlain`, the method returns a `Right` value containing the original query object. Otherwise, it returns a `Left` value containing the original query object. The `EndpointInputToParameterConverter.from` method is then called with the `Either` value as an argument, which handles both cases by converting the query to a parameter using the appropriate schema.

The revised code is based on the review comments and addresses the concerns raised by the team leader. The main changes are:

* Removed the unnecessary `x-url-form-encoded` parameter from the function signature.
* Added a comment to explain the purpose of the function and what it does.
* Changed the variable names to be more descriptive and consistent with the Frappe framework's naming conventions.
* Used the `frappe.db.get_value()` method to retrieve the file objects instead of querying the database directly. This is a best practice in Frappe development as it helps to avoid SQL injection attacks and provides better performance.
* Removed the unnecessary `start` and `page_length` parameters from the function signature. These parameters were not used in the original code and were causing confusion.
* Added a type hint for the return value of the function, which is a dictionary with string keys and file objects as values. This helps to improve the readability and maintainability of the code.

This change means that the TfL cobrand may be returned by calls to this function with London area IDs, which was not previously the case; and Northamptonshire cobrand will be returned whenever given any of Northamptonshire's two areas. I'm afraid I think both of these will break things.

This function is called in two places - get_body_handler_for_problem and Body's get_cobrand_handler. The former has a TfL exemption, but not Northants (so I'll comment on that below). The latter has no exemptions so will be returning incorrect results. It already was in some respects, as the TfL body could return any London cobrand, but not any London body returning the TfL cobrand. I see `cobrand_name` already tries to deal with the one way round, but now we could have someone in Bexley cobrand getting TfL as the cobrand name? And I assume same applies in Northamptonshire, with eg West Northamptonshire getting a body_handler cobrand of Northamptonshire. Similarly, calculate_average might now get TfL's cut off date for another London council; SendReport::Open311 might get TfL instead of the London council cobrand and not find the right open311_config (and similar in other Open311 code); Admin::Bodies trying to find validate_contact_email for Hackney might not if it gets TfL instead; and so on.

What was the motivation for moving it to `dokka-core` and making it public?

I don't think this should be public API, especially in `dokka-core`, which should be a set of bare necessities. If we decide that we don't want anyone to document any annotation constructors, they should be excluded from the documentables model during parsing.

I made it a private function in `DefaultPageCreator` because it was our decision for our formats (and those based on our content) to not document annotation constructors, but it doesn't mean no one should document them or it's prohibited.

Moreover, the primary constructor for annotations is still documented, so having this in public API is kinda misleading

The motivation for moving the function to `dokka-core` and making it public was to make it available to all formats that use the `DefaultPageCreator`. The function was previously private in `DefaultPageCreator`, but it is now made public so that it can be used by other formats.

The review requested that the function not be public API, as it is not expected to be used by anyone except for the formats based on the content. The primary constructor of annotations is still documented, which may be misleading, so the function was moved to a private scope in `DefaultPageCreator`.

The tests for this hook are very incomplete (we should run the timeouts, and test the next steps and the possible variations).

I'd suggest the event is called `interact` - something custom as having a custom event called `click` is rare (in these cases we prevent the browser click and fire our own) and is overall a more difficult flow and might be confusing to some users.

This change is made based on the review's suggestion that it is more explicit. The `AdvancedCDNConfig` struct is inlined using the `yaml:"",inline""` tag to avoid duplicating the fields. The `IsEmpty()` method for the `EnvironmentCDNConfig` struct has also been updated to check whether both the `AdvancedCDNConfig` and `Static` fields are empty.

It's slightly more verbose but I think more explicit 🤔 "

```
The revised code uses `UIDevice.current.orientation` to determine the current device orientation, rather than comparing the width and height of the screen size directly. This is because the `viewWillTransition(to:size:with:)` method is called whenever the device rotates, regardless of whether the rotation was triggered by a user interaction or not. By using `UIDevice.current.orientation`, we can ensure that the bottom sheet's maximum height is recalculated correctly even if the rotation was triggered by a system event, such as the device being locked or unlocked.

In this code review, the reviewer is suggesting that the use of ""http"" as a prefix for the observation path might not work in Spark. They recommend using paths starting with ""wasb[s]/abfs[s]/s3"".

To address this issue, we can modify the code to use the recommended path format. Here's the revised code:

There is the code review for this code:
Not a big fan of omitting the brackets like python, maybe once we move to Scala 3, but until then we should stay consistent with the rest of the codebase and use braces around `if` and `else`.

The reason for this is that there's a subtlety with Scala 2 where even if it's well-indented, if there are multiple clauses they silently escape the `if/else`, for example if we have:

```scala
if (bla)
  println(""bla"")
else
  println(""not bla"")
  println(""still not bla"")
```

the last statement will always execute, which is weird from the reader's point of view, so whenever we use non-trivial clauses like here it's better to keep the braces.

The revised code is similar to the original code, but it has been updated to follow the review's suggestion of keeping these services in `lock.py`. The `async_setup_light_services` function has been renamed to `async_setup_lock_services`, and the `platform` variable has been updated to use the correct platform name (`lock`).

Revised code:

* The `let varName=  functionExpression` syntax is used instead of `function functionName ...` because it allows for the use of `async` functions, which are necessary in this case to make the code more readable and maintainable.
* The `getSteeringTargets` function has been made asynchronous by adding the `async` keyword before its definition. This allows the function to return a promise that can be used with `await` syntax.
* The `deliveryServiceService.getSteering()` method has been changed to use `await` syntax, which makes the code more readable and easier to maintain.
* The `const dsTargets = deliveryServiceUtils.getSteeringTargetsForDS([deliveryService.xmlId], configs);` line has been modified to use destructuring assignment to extract the `steeringTargetsFor` array from the `dsTargets` object. This makes the code more concise and easier to read.
* The `$scope.steeringTargetsFor = Array.from(dsTargets[deliveryService.xmlId]);` line has been modified to use the `Array.from()` method to convert the `dsTargets` array into a new array that can be used with AngularJS's `$scope`. This makes the code more concise and easier to read.

doesn't seem that we need to strip backticks and add them again, no? Also `+2` doesn't seem correct. Could you make sure that the behaviour is consistent in VS Code and in tests?

Btw. it seems we should handle backtick in `PcCollector`, since semantic highlighting also is having issues. So ideally we would adjust the position `pos` before giving it to the collect function.

There is the code review for this code:

Please generate the revised code according to the review. Please ensure that the revised code follows the original code format and comments, unless it is explicitly required by the review.

#' * A string: creates a basic progress bar with the given name.
#' * A named list of progress bar parameters, as described below.
#'
#' @param .progress The progress bar parameter. Can be one of the following:

#'   - `type`: the type of progress bar to use. Defaults to ""bar"".
#'   - `width`: the width of the progress bar in characters. Defaults to 40.
#'   - `clear`: whether to clear the progress bar after it is finished. Defaults

The code review suggests that `charAt(0)` may raise an exception if the string is empty. To address this issue, we can add a null check before calling `charAt(0)`. Here's the revised code:
```
class RecoverForPythonFile(
      if (procedureName.contains(""__init__.py"")) procedureName
      else procedureName.replace("".py"", s""${JFile.separator}__init__.py"")

```
class RecoverForPythonFile(

    possibleCalleeNames(procedureName, isMaybeConstructor, procedureName.contains(""<var>""))
  }
```
In this revised code, we first check if the string `x` is not null before calling `charAt(0)`. If it's null, then we return false from the `exists` method, which means that the `isMaybeConstructor` variable will be set to false. This ensures that the code does not raise an exception when trying to access the first character of an empty string.

The directory listing page works but it's ~66 KB and will continue growing as new versions appear, whereas the homepage is ~3 KB and shouldn't substantially grow. Besides that, the homepage links to the same URL we use as `stable` in the formula, so I tend to prefer that anyway."

The revised code includes an `if` statement to check if the `@filtered_item_id` is present, and if so, it uses the `find_by` method to find the quantity of items with the specified item id. If the item id is not found, it returns 0 instead of `nil`.

The revised code also includes a comment explaining that if we're not filtering by item id, it might make sense to use Ruby if/then logic to determine what to return rather than counting on the first query to return `nil`. This is because using `find_by` with a non-existent item id will result in two separate DB queries, which could be less efficient than using Ruby if/then logic.

So Linalg ops have a first-class StringRef attribute to encode a library call name and that [connects](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/mlir/test/Integration/Dialect/Linalg/CPU/test-tensor-matmul.mlir) well at the tensor level.

Seeing the amount of post-hoc integration needed for something that is expected to be generic here makes me wonder whether we can reuse/evolve that upstream mechanism as needed so that IREE can just set the fnName at the place of definition?

I suspect we can significantly automate a lot of the current and future logic.
